146,Epi- and hyperbenthic communities of Belgian sandy beaches,,NA,Attribution (CC BY),NA,"This is the first study on the epi- and hyperbenthic fauna of the surf zone of sandy beaches of the Belgian coast. Therefore, as a first objective of this thesis, a lot of attention has been paid to the inventarisation (species composition), and to the investigation of the temporal and spatial distribution patterns of both communities. A temporal and a spatial campaign were performed during which the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled.","During the temporal campaign monthly samples were taken at 4 selected stations and the spatial campaign involved sampling of 12 stations along the Belgian coast. All in all, the surf zone of the Belgian coast is a habitat for a considerable number of species. The surf zone harbours a rich hyperbenthic fauna and also the epibenthic assemblage is diverse. Total hyper- and epibenthic densities were comparable or even higher than those of the adjacent, subtidal regions. It seems that the Belgian surf zone can be seen as an extension of the rich shallow sand bank system in front of the coast. Differences in total hyperbenthic densities with other European sandy beaches might be linked to the degree of exposure. An attempt was made to elucidate the major environmental variables structuring the communities. Therefore several environmental variables were measured at the moments of sampling. Different uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used for the analyses of the data. Although clear temperature-related seasonal distribution patterns were observed, the hyper- and epibenthic communities of the surf zone can also be influenced severely by hydrodynamic factors and this both by short-term events (e.g. storm) and long-term effects (influence on morpho- dynamics of the beach). Spatial differences were found both in species richness and in density. In general, highest hyper- and epibenthic densities were found on flat, wide beaches, but also intermediate sites and sites with a high turbidity were characterised with high densities and a high number of species. Although clear distribution patterns could be observed, the much lower densities of the epibenthos compared to the hyperbenthos, might require a higher sampling effort with replicate sampling in future research. Furthermore, this study indicates that both intertidal and subtidal characteristics should be considered if the (mobile) surf zone fauna is investigated. Stomach/gut content analyses were performed on five common flatfish fish species from epibenthic samples taken during the temporal campaign in order to unravel part of the surf zone food web. Additional fish were obtained from commercial fishermen. Prey items of all species included hyperbenthic (e.g. mysids), endobenthic (e.g. polychaetes) and epibenthic (e.g. shrimps) species. Little dietary overlap was observed. If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of the studied beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results confirm the opportunistic utilisation by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Such opportunistic utilisation of food resources can be important for teleosts frequenting physically stressed environments such as surf-exposed beaches. The diets of turbot Scophthalmus maximus and brill Scophthalmus rhombus reveal part of the main interactions between the hyper- and epibenthos, whereas those of plaice Pleuronectes platessa, dab Limanda limanda and sole Solea solea reveal important links between the epibenthos and the macro-endobenthos within the local surf zone food web. Three 24-hours sampling cycles were performed to study short term migration patterns. Again the hyper- and epibenthos was sampled alternatingly each hour. Stomach content analyses were performed on juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa of the first 24h-cycle (spring tide). Possible interactions between the epi- and hyperbenthic organisms are discussed. Despite the turbulent conditions of the studied sites, clear tidal (e.g. I-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa, the brown shrimp Crangon crangon) and diurnal (e.g. juvenile sole Solea solea) periodicities were observed in many macrocrustacean and demersal fish species. An opportunistic utilisation of available food resources is again suggested as I-group plaice clearly migrate high up the beach during flood to disperse in order to profit from the rich macrobenthic area (mainly the polychaete Scolelepis squamata and ends of Arenicola species), while the 0-group feeds mainly on the most abundant hyper- and macrobenthic organisms from somewhat deeper water (mainly palps of the polychaete Magelona papillicornis and cyprid larvae). Finally, it can be concluded that the Belgian surf zone functions as a nursery and/or transient are for hyper- as well as epibenthic stages of several species.",Bregje Beyst,FALSE,FALSE,"Biology , Benthos , Coastal studies (e.g. shores, estuaries)","Beaches , Benthic communities , Epibenthos , Hyperbenthos , Sandy beaches"

The CPR survey has been in operation in the North Sea and North Atlantic since 1946 and has systematically sampled up to 500 planktonic taxa from the major regions of the North Atlantic at a monthly resolution. This dataset contains also CPR surveys in the Pacific and the South Atlantic.,"The Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey has been operating in the North Atlantic and North Sea since 1946 and measures the abundance of approximately 450 phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa (Warner and Hays, 1994). The CPR is a high-speed plankton recorder that is towed behind ‘ships of opportunity’ through the surface layer of the ocean (~10 m depth). Water passes through the recorder, and plankton are filtered by a slow moving silk (mesh size 270 µm). A second layer of silk covers the first and both are reeled into a tank containing 4% formaldehyde. Upon returning to the laboratory, the silk on is unwound and cut into sections corresponding to 10 nautical miles and approximately 3 m3 of filtered sea water. The colour of each section of CPR silk is then evaluated and categorized according to four levels of ‘greenness’ (green, pale green, very pale green and no colour) using a standard colour chart; these numbers are given a numerical value as a measure of the ‘Phytoplankton Colour Index’. This is a semiquantitative measure of phytoplankton biomass; the silk gets its green colour from the chloroplasts of the filtered phytoplankton. Phytoplankton cells are then identified and recorded as either present or absent across 20 microscopic fields spanning each section of silk; CPR phytoplankton abundance is therefore a semiquantitative estimate (i.e. the species is recorded once per field independent of the number of cells in a field). However, the proportion of cells captured by the silk reflects the major changes in abundance, distribution, and community composition of the phytoplankton (Robinson, 1970), and is consistent and comparable over time. Zooplankton analysis then carried out in two stages with small (<2 mm) zooplankton identified and counted on-silk and larger (>2 mm) zooplankton enumerated off-silk. The collection and analysis of CPR samples have been carried out using a consistent methodological approach since 1958, making the CPR survey the longest continuous dataset of its kind in the world (Edwards and Richardson, 2004).",,FALSE,FALSE,"Ecology - biodiversity , Phytoplankton , Zooplankton","Phytoplankton , Plankton , Zooplankton"

A broad spectrum of data is collected during the survey, but the overriding objective is to provide information on commercially exploited fish stocks. In particular the survey provides an index of the proportion of juveniles in the stock, which in turn gives an indication of its spawning success. This is an important source of information not available from commercial landings due to the necessary minimum fish length restrictions on commercial catches. 

In addition, the survey provides data on species and environmental parameters in areas of both high and low commercial activity. This gives a better context to data for the entire survey area as opposed to focusing entirely on traditional fishing hot-spots that can remain stable while significant changes in surrounding background abundance and distribution go un-noticed.

The primary goal of the groundfish survey is to develop estimates of juvenile abundance for important species. Measurements of the abundance of juvenile fish are a critical measure of the health of a stock, serving as an annual indication of recruitment (the number of newly spawned fish which enter the population each year) success or failure. Most importantly, they allow forecasting of future commercial abundance. 

Survey provides data on the distribution and biology of commercial and non-commercial species of ecological interest, as well as hydrographic and environmental observations. When these data are combined with annual recruitment indices they can help identify the possible causes driving year-class success or failure, and allow us to see long-term changes in populations that may have been caused by fishing, pollution, or climate change. This spatial dataset comprises the haul station location from the trawl survey. The Irish Groundfish Survey feeds into the International Bottom Trawl Survey [ie. IBTS] for international reporting. 

The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey started in 1990 and for the first two years consisted of circa 25 stations concentrated around the Irish coast in ICES Areas Via South and VIIb. Adverse weather in 1992 limited station coverage to only 4 stations which effectively broke the time series.

The survey was re-established in 1993 and has consisted of circa 70 stations, for Parts A and B combined, since then. Spatial coverage was extended west out to the 200m contour, but remains as Via South and VIIb.

Due to the restrictions of the current and previous research vessel commercial trawlers have been contracted to carry out the survey work. Wherever possible continuity of vessel and gear has been maintained and standard IBTS methodology applied. However, due to reduced staffing on commercial vessels it has rarely been possible to completely sort the catch.

Until 2000 all cod were sorted from the catch and then a sub-sample of two baskets was taken and completely sorted. From 2001 onwards, in response to an overall review of survey sampling undertaken during the IPROSTS Project (Anon 2001), the catch is completely sorted for all target species and a qualitative assessment made of the residual catch as a minimum.

The Irish surveys use an ICES rectangle based sampling strategy. The sampling design attempts to allocate at least two stations per rectangle (where the sea area is appropriate). Stations are selected randomly within each rectangle from known clear tow positions.

On the WCGS and ISCGS circa 70 fishing stations are planned on each survey every year. The number of hauls is adjusted according to the ship time available at sea.

The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey is carried out in two parts: Part A covers ICES Division Via (south) and VIIb (north); Part B covers ICES Division VIIb and VIIj. The survey is conducted from 15 to 300 m depths during the fourth quarter (October - November). The Irish West Coast Groundfish Survey is carried out on chartered commercial fishing vessels. Whilst the same vessel (MFV Marliona, 224 gross tonnage and 30 m LOA) has normally been used each year for Part A and Sionann for Part B, in 2001 Part B was conducted from the MFV Regina Ponti (34.5 m LOA). Both vessels use a Rockhopper net with 12 inch discs and 11 inch Thyboron doors. The nets are fitted with a 20 mm codend liner. Gear performance throughout the survey is monitored using Furuno Ch24 (Headline Monitor).

The Irish Sea Celtic Ground Survey commenced in 1997 and evolved from an earlier Irish Sea Juvenile Fish Survey. As a consequence early survey stations concentrated largely, though not exclusively, around a number of shallow spawning areas along the Irish east coast in VIIa. These positions were expanded in combination with clear tows provided by the industry and CEFAS as well as some exploratory tows.

Spatial coverage therefore extended into the western Irish Sea from 2001 into the area around the Isle of Man, Liverpool and Cardigan Bays and the Welsh coast. The survey is carried out on the Irish research vessel the R.V. Celtic Voyager.

The sampling procedure on board conforms to the IBTS standard protocols and as such all cod are sampled and aged, the entire catch is sorted and then sub-sampled as and where appropriate.

The Irish survey in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea covers ICES Division VIIa and VIIg. The survey is conducted from 10 to 150 m depths during the fourth quarter (November-December) by the RV Celtic Voyager. This vessel is 32 m in length with gross tonnage of 340 t. The fishing gear used is a GOV 28.9/37.1 Trawl with Morgere Kite (0.85 by 0.85m). Mean vertical opening is 6 m and door spread 48 m. Morgere Polyvalent doors (Type AA4.5) are used and gear performance is monitored throughout the survey using the SCANMAR (RX400) net monitoring system (Headline height, Door spread).

Trials on the new 65m research vessel, the R.V. Celtic Explorer, are due to commence in late 2002. Therefore, from 2003 onwards all Irish Surveys will be conducted on this new vessel, starting around mid October through to late November.",Neil Holdsworth,FALSE,FALSE,Fish,

As it was gradually realised that the survey also yielded valuable information for other fish species, such as cod and haddock, the objectives were broadened and the survey was renamed into the International Young Fish Survey (IYFS). Besides the IYFS, which was carried out in the first quarter, a number of national surveys developed in the 1970's and 1980's that were mainly carried out in the third quarter. 

In 1990 ICES decided to combine the international and the national surveys into the IBTS. The IBTS is carried out twice per year (1st and 3rd Quarters) since 1997 and on a quarterly basis in the period 1991-1996.

Prior to 1977 there was no standardisation of gear although all ships used bottom trawls with a small mesh cover. In 1977 ICES recommended that all ships should use a GOV trawl as specified by the Institut des Peches Maritimes, Boulogne. A detailed description of the net is to be found in the manual (Anon. 2004). The GOV trawl has been gradually phased in, e.g. in 1979 only 3 vessels were equipped with the GOV trawl, but by 1983 all 8 nations were using this gear. It should be noted that although the gear is now standard, variations in the rigging exist between the various countries. 

The fishing method is also standardized and described in the manual (Anon. 2004). Fishing speed is 4 knots measured as trawl speed over the ground. In 1977 ICES also recommended that the duration of a tow should be reduced from an hour to half an hour with the catch data to be expressed in numbers per hour.

Trawl stations are selected at one tow per rectangle based on a library of clear tows. There is no explicit return to the same trawling position every year, although this is generally the case. 

Since 1999 the potential for using a depth rather than rectangle based stratification has been under investigation. To this end, and where possible, those rectangles which display substantial internal depth variation have been sampled twice at different depths. The recent inclusion of samples collected between 200 and 500m would suggest that depth stratification should be initiated as soon as possible.

The survey covers Division Via and extends into the northern part of the Irish Sea and north west of Ireland. The depth range covered has been 20 to 500m since 2000.

More then 10,000 divers have already registered with Diveboard and the community is still growing. This dataset contains all observations made by Diveboarders worldwide (mainly fishes) and are linked to the Encyclopedia of Life. The Diveboard community has dedicated the data to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver, so these can be used as widely as possible. If you have a specific survey need or question, get in touch: Diveboarders are everywhere and willing to help!","Purpose - Diveboarders share their data with the desire to help the scientific community in research towards protecting the biodiversity of our oceans, seas, and freshwater bodies. So far, the data are not generated with any overarching purpose, other than completing ones personal digital log of dives.

Additional information - The data is collected with the help of divers all around the world. If you have questions regarding surveying specific dive sites, you can contact us at support@diveboard.com and we will see what we can do. The dataset was standardized, documented and published with the help of Datafable, a team of open data volunteers. The process is documented here: https://github.com/Datafable/diveboard-gbif.

Taxonomic coverage - The dataset covers animals (and very few plants) observed during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. Close to 80% of the observations are fishes (Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii). Diveboarders can log their dives online, including the species they observed, using the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org) as a checklist. Most of the observations are identified to species level, though some caution regarding the identifications is appropriate. In case of doubt, the observer/identifier can be contacted via the references field, which references his/her Diveboard profile.

Study extent - The dataset covers recorded observations made during scuba dives performed by members of the Diveboard community. As such there is no specific geographic or temporal study extent, although most dives logged on Diveboard were conducted in well known divespots, such as reefs and wrecks. In a later phase, specific surveys might also be logged on Diveboard.

Sampling description - Observations are not recorded with a specific goal in mind and only reflect what the diver has noticed during the dive. Divers rarely conduct a full inventory of a dive spot, so the observed species only represent part of the occurring species at the time of the dive. There is a sampling bias for known, interesting, noticeable and/or rare species.

Quality control - The Diveboard application restricts divers to only record species found in the Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org). As such, all observations are linked to an EOL page in the field taxonID. It is important to note that the data are not validated by specialists.

Method - Event and location conditions (date, time, depth, etc.) are often logged automatically by the dive computer. This data can be imported or manually added by the diver in the Diveboard application, while observed species are added manually. These actions can be done just after surfacing, as the Diveboard application is available online and as a mobile app, which allows divers to record their dive even if no internet connection is available.",Dimitri Brosens,FALSE,FALSE,"Fish , Invertebrates , Macroalgae , Reptiles","Citizen science , Scuba diving , Volunteers"

At each station and each sampling period, four sediment cores were sampled from which one was dedicated to the grain-size analysis and the remaining three to the microphytobenthic abundance (ABU) and community composition. 

Samplings were carried out during four sampling campaigns in the following periods: June and October 2012, May 2013 and May 2014. A total of five stations were sampled: three near Basiluzzo Island, characterised by different sediment colour and gas emission, and two NE of Panarea Island on a sampling site referred as “Hot-Cold” where the sediments are subjected to very different temperatures at a distance of approximately 1 m one from another. 


    For the quantitative determination of microphytobenthos (MPB), the uppermost sediment layer obtained from three distinct sediment cores was fixed with 10 mL of 4% formaldehyde buffered solution (CaMg(CO3)2) in pre-filtered seawater (0.2 µm filter) and stored at 4 °C until processing. For each sampling, three replicates were counted for the Basiluzzo samples and two for the Hot-Cold stations as for the latter the standard deviation did not exceed 15%. After manual stirring, 125 µL aliquots of the sediment suspension were drawn off and placed in a counting chamber. To obtain an estimate of the total viable cells, only cells containing pigments and not empty frustules were counted under a Leitz inverted light microscope (Leica Microsystems AG) using a 32× objective (320× final magnification) (Utermöhl, 1958).
    Microphytobenthos community was divided into major taxonomic groups and within the group of diatoms more precise species identification was attempted. Diatoms frustule cleaning was performed by oxidizing subsamples with two time volume of hydrogen peroxide (35%) and ˜1 mL of sulphuric acid (95–97%) (CEN, 2003). Between single treatments, the subsamples were heated over a Bunsen burner until boiling and left under the hood for 24 h. After that, they were washed with Milli-Q water and left to settle for at least 24 h between single washings, until reaching a pH close to 7. All samples were then mounted on permanent slides in Naphrax™ (Northern Biological Supplies Ltd. Ipswich, UK) and observed under 1000× final magnification using a light microscope (LM) (Leica DM2500, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Leica DFC490, Germany).

MEDITS is a program of bottom trawl surveys developed annually in the Mediterranean, in which all the participants use the same gear, sampling protocol and methodology, with the objective to evaluate the abundance and distribution of stocks, independently of the data provided by commercial fisheries, and to assess the impact of the fishing activity on the environment.","A protocol exists to be applied, which is reviewed and adapted during the annual coordination meetings. This protocol includes the design of the survey, the sampling gear (feature and handling), the information collected and the management of the data. MEDITS surveys are currently conducted by eleven Mediterranean countries (Albania, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia and Spain), within the European Commission framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the common fisheries policy (Data Collection Multiannual Program), with the financial support from the DG MARE and Member States. <br></br>
In Spain, the MEDITS surveys are developed annually from April to June, on board the R/V Cornide de Saavedra (1994-2013) and the R/V Miguel Oliver (2014-2017), along the infralittoral, circalittoral and bathyal soft bottoms off Mediterranean Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (Geographical Sub-Areas GSAs of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean GFCM 1, 2, 5 and 6) between 30 and 800 m depth. As the other MEDITS areas, and following the MEDITS protocol, it is applied a stratified random sampling, taken into account five depth strata (30-50, 51-100, 101-200, 201-500 and 501-800 m) and the four Geographical Sub-Areas (GSA) established by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in the area: 1 and 2 (Northern Alboran and Alboran Island, respectively), 5 (Balearic Islands) and 6 (Northern Spain). The bottom trawl hauls are performed during daylight, with an effective duration (from the arrival of the gear to the seabed until its departure) of 30 and 60 minutes, depending on the depth (<200 and >200 m, respectively) and the speed is around 3 knots. The sampling gear is a bottom trawl made of four panels, referenced as GOC73, with 10 mm of mesh side in the codend and doors of type Morgére, with 2.5-3 m vertical opening and 16-22, horizontal opening. SCANMAR system is used in each haul to estimate its effective duration and the geometry of the net. Moreover, a CTD SBE-37 is attached to the flotsam of the net to record temperature and conductivity of the water above the seafloor during the haul. On board the vessel, the catches are split into the categories and sub-categories, according the MEDITS protocol, and the total weight and number of individuals is collected. The common coding system adopted for the complete set of species is a RUBIN like coding system as defined in the NCC standard, even if this international coding system has been no longer maintained for some years. This coding system appears to be a very practical one and it would be very easy in the future to build a correspondence table with any new coding system. In respect to the NCC recommendations and as the MEDITS coding is not strictly identical to the RUBIN one (different use, species not referenced to in the RUBIN code), the ""name"" of this code has been changed and is for the purpose of the MEDITS called ""FM list"". The species identifications are made following Fisher et al. (1987). For the fish species not included in this work, the descriptions from Whitehead et al. (1984) have been used. Since 2012, the MEDITS reference list includes 82 target species. For all these species, the total number of individuals, the total weight and the individual length should be collected. This list has been further split in two groups: (i) MEDITS G1 includes 41 species with 9 demersal (3 fish, 4 crustaceans and 2 cephalopods) and 32 chondrictians, for which the total number of individuals, the total weight, the individual length and also biological parameters including sex, maturity (according to , individual weight and age (age has been proposed only for the teleosts of the Group 1) should be collected; and (ii) MEDITS G2 includes 43 species for which only total number of individuals, total weight and individual length should be collected. Standard formats are defined for the data storage and to facilitate the exchange of the data produced by the MEDITS surveys. The exchange files are in “*.csv” format, using semicolon as field separator. Four file types are defined in order to store and exchange the data: (Type A) characteristics of haul; (Type B) catches by haul; (Type C) length, sex, and maturity at aggregated level; and (Type E) age, weight and maturity by length at individual level.

Quantitative phytoplankton samples (58 samples at 25 stations) were collected by vertical series consisting from several sampling depths. The depths were chosen aiming to collect samples from main hydrophysical layers. At each station these layers were defined according to the CTD-sounding performed before the phytoplankton sampling. A special attention paid to the fluorescence profiles obtained simultaneously with the CTD-sounding. The samples were collected from upper mixed layer, upper thermocline layer, and deep chlorophyll-a maximum depth. When the vertical distribution of fluorescence allowed to suppose the presence of phytoplankton at such depths, samples from the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL) at several stations, lower thermocline and near bottom layers were collected additionally. For sample collecting 5L Niskis bottles attached to the CTD rosette system were used. Volume of sample was equal to 3 L. Sampling performed by A. Zotov (IMB NANU), M.

The abundance (biovolume) as well as the specific and population structures of epi- (living in 0 to 150 meter depth) and mesoplanktonic (living in 150 to 1000 meter depth) communities were used to assess the condition of zooplanktonic populations.,"On October 25, 1994, the N.R.P. ""S. Miguel,"" which was carrying a large amount of old military equipment, was sunk. The ship was sunk in the waters of the Portuguese continental EEZ, near the EEZ's outer edge and the Lisbon parallel. This sinking, which was attempted under controlled conditions under the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution, was marred by a mishap, and the ship burst on the surface of the sea before sinking. In addition to the immediate impact of the N.R.P. ""S. Miguel"" explosion, which was attempted to detect based on a possible decrease in zooplanktonic biomass values in the surface water bed (200 m) in the immediate sinking area, it was also intended to know some ""normal"" bio-oceanographic conditions in order to detect possible future changes caused by pollutants on board the N.R.P. ""S. Miguel"".

The epizooplanktonic material was sampled in oblique trawls up to a depth of 200 m using a Bongo 60 net (circular double-mouth net 60 cm in diameter and fitted with two mesh bags of 335 and 505 m aperture). The volume of water sampled in each haul was calculated using the readings of flowmeters attached to each net's mouth. Mesozooplankton was collected using a 10 m2 mouth area Isaacs-Kidd Midwater Raul (IKMT) net with a 505 m mesh bag. The hauls took around 30 minutes to complete at the desired depth.

Study Extent	The epizooplankton was collected in 12 sampling stations, which were distributed as follows: Three stations along the Portuguese coast, one at the sinking site, four surrounding the sinking site and ten miles apart, two at the Josephine bank and one at the Bank Gorringe.

All zooplanktonic material collected was kept in 4 percent neutral formalin, with the exception of a tiny portion of the material collected with IKMT that was frozen for examination of the concentration of heavy metals and PCBs. The biovolume of plankton samples was computed in the lab using the volume of water displaced by the organic material after large organisms (&gt; 1 cm in epizooplankton and &gt; 2.5 cm in mesozooplankton) were removed, and its abundance was calculated per 100 m3 of filtered water. Using a magnifying glass and a binocular microscope, species identification and enumeration were carried out in a counting chamber.",Antonina Dos Santos,FALSE,FALSE,Zooplankton,

Also, the socio-economic importance of the BCS is very high. As in most areas around the North Sea, a lot of anthropogenic activities, such as sea fisheries, maritime transport, military shootings, dredging activities and others occur on the BCS.<p>The combination of the ecological and the socio-economic value of the BCS causes conflicts between both interests. Therefore it is very important to develop a sustainable management plan for the natural resources of the BCS. To obtain this goal, information and knowledge is required about:<ul><li>geographical distribution of the marine biological communities,<li>the structure of these communities,<li>their relationship with the physical and the chemical environment,<li>the natural ecological and genetic variability, and<li>the nature and the effect of the anthropogenic influences on these ecosystem components. </ul><p>Macrobenthic organisms are good candidates for monitoring the short and long-term effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts on and within the marine environment because of their direct link with the sediment and with the processes that occur immediately above the sediments.<p>The <b>global objective</b> of this project is to deliver a substantial contribution to the knowledge of the long term variability in the biodiversity of the macrobenthos and the relationship with anthropogenic activities.<p>The <b>specific aim</b> of this website is to deliver an atlas with distribution maps of the macrobenthos of the Belgian Coastal Shelf (BCS) for the periods 1977-1983 and 1994-2000. Besides biogeographic and taxonomy information, which is given for each taxon, descriptive details on morphology, biology, ecology, habitat preferences and illustrations are given for a limited number a taxa (see list below).

Multivariate statistics indicate that the sampling stations cover a heterogeneous area with different types of community composition, as might be expected, since the Pechora Sea encompasses a wide range of depths and oceanographic conditions. However, some distinct station groupings were evident, which are considered to represent different faunal community types. Around the Island of Kolguyev, the fauna was dominated by sub-surface detritivorous Polychaeta. On the coast of Novaya Zemlya, the Chernaya Fjord contained an opportunistic faunal composition. The deep area immediately south of Novaya Zemlya was characterised by high numbers of large, surface deposit feeding Polychaeta. The Kara Strait area showed some spatial variation in faunal characteristics, but generally contained high numbers of surface deposit feeding Polychaeta and Crustacea, as well as encrusting suspensivores on stones. The stations sampled between Kolguyev and the Pechora Bay contained large amounts of macrofaunal Foraminifera and detritivorous Polychaeta, while the fauna sampled in the Pechora Bay was typical of northern, low salinity environments. Canonical correspondence analyses indicate that water depth and sediment type play a major role in structuring the benthic fauna. The distribution of community types described in this investigation largely follow those outlined in previous Russian investigations, despite the use of different analytical strategies. This investigation provides the background for an intercomparison of methodologies in faunal analyses.

A standard 2 m Lowesoft beam trawl with a 3 mm mesh codend liner was deployed for 5-10 min across each station at a speed of about 0.5 m/s. The ""start"" (locking of winch following seabed contact) and ""end"" (commencement of hauling) positions were recorded. Tow length averaged about 400 m, but varied substantially (s.d. = 290) depending on tidal current velocity and wind strength at the time of sampling. On retrieval of the trawl, an estimate of sample volume was made, along with a summary of the contents, noting especially the presence of stones, rock, etc. The sample was then sorted on deck over a 5 mm mesh sieve. Most specimens were identified and enumerated at sea. Any problematic specimens were preserved in formalin for identification on land.

The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as 'biotopes') in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.

Methods of data capture
The majority of data were collected using methods described in the MNCR Rational and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Broadly, this encompassed surveying a range of sites within a geographical area to sample and describe the variety of habitats present (sampling habitats in different substrata, depths, wave exposures, current regimes, salinity regimes and so on). Each habitat was sampled using semi-quantitative recording techniques (SACFOR abundance scales) for recording epibiota on rocky habitats.

Geographical Coverage
This dataset relates to Wales. Note however that the dataset ""Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) and associated benthic marine data held and managed by JNCC"" also includes equivalent and complementary data from Wales.

Temporal Coverage 
The data were collected post 1993. 

Data Quality
The data have been extensively checked during the course of the creation of the various reports produced by the MNCR programme. This included the MNCR Area Summary report series which describes the marine habitats in particular regions around the UK and the creation of the national marine habitat (biotope) classification system. Through this work the vast majority of the anomalies and errors in the data should have been identified but some may still remain.",,TRUE,TRUE,"Biology , Benthos , Fish , Macroalgae","Biodiversity , Marine biodiversity"

Additionally species records determined from SNH analysis of third party commissioned benthic survey video footage are included. The dataset contains surveys which contributed to the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) programme, EU-funded BioMar Life project, SNH Site Condition Monitoring including broad scale surveys in support of the Natura process, surveys to establish the impact of specific activities on marine habitats and species and surveys to support the Scottish Marine Protected Areas project.","Purpose of data capture: Records in this dataset were originally collected for a variety of purposes including: identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance, to support protected site designation or to support site condition monitoring. This dataset is a collation of species records from these surveys and has been produced to mobilise these records to a broad spectrum of users and in so doing it contributes to Scottish Natural Heritage?s ongoing commitment to the National Biodiversity Network.

Methods of data capture: Records in the dataset were collected as a result of commissioned surveys which used a range of methodologies often closely aligned with those of the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) as described in the MNCR Rational and Methods report (Hiscock 1996). Surveys were typically undertaken using one or more of the following techniques, remotely operated video (ROV), drop-down or towed video, grab sampling, core sampling, clump sampling, diver video, MNCR phase 2 diver recording, and intertidal transects and quadrats. Most commonly semi-quantitative recording techniques have been applied using the SACFOR abundance scale, but species presence, and count data have also been used. Typically although not presented in this dataset the surveys would also have described the variety of habitats present (detailing substrata, depths, wave exposures, current regimes, salinity and so on). Verification and validation of records has typically focused on a quality assurance protocol for taxon determination and data entry.

Geographical coverage: The records in this dataset relate to the Scottish Marine Area, but have a predominant near-shore focus in their distribution.

Temporal coverage: The records present in this dataset relate to field surveys 1993 up to and including 2012.

Data quality: The majority of records have been subjected to quality assurance procedures which includes an independent oversight of a sub-set of records from each survey and specialist taxonomic input. In addition some of the data has been subject to NMBAQC protocols. Additionally, SNH project managers? have an oversight on the survey deliverables. Overall confidence in the dataset is high although it is conceivable that errors exist in this dataset. SNH view mobilisation of these records to the NBN Gateway as a further mechanism for assuring data quality. If users of the Gateway identify potential errors in the dataset then these should be flagged with SNH who will consider all feedback.",,TRUE,TRUE,"Biology , Benthos , Fish , Invertebrates , Macroalgae , Plants",Biodiversity

Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture, Burnham laboratory, Essex, UK.",NA,Attribution (CC BY),,Broadscale benthic survey undertaken by CEFAS off the east coast of the United Kingdom.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was any evidence of a large-scale cumulative impact on benthic macro-invertebrate communities as a result of the multiple sites of aggregate extraction located off Great Yarmouth in the southern North Sea.  Forty 0.1m2 Hamon grab samples were collected from across the region, both within and beyond the extraction area, and analysed for macrofauna and sediment particle size distribution in order to produce a regional description of the status of the seabed environment.  In addition, the data were analysed in relation to the area of seabed impacted by dredging over the period 1993-1998.  Areas subject to ‘direct’ impacts were determined through reference to annual electronic records of dredging activity and this information was then used to model the likely extent of areas potentially subject to ‘indirect’ ecological and geophysical impact.  Results showed the study area to be characterised by sands in the northern half of the survey area, and sandy gravels in the south.  The low diversity communities found across much of the survey area were typical of mobile sandy sediments.  However, stations located in the southern half and northern extreme of the survey area tended to support higher numbers of species and individuals.  This may be due to marginally enhanced stability arising from the higher proportion of gravel found in samples to the south of the extraction licences and to the presence of Sabellaria spinulosa reef in the north.  Analysis of data in relation to areas of predicted dredging impact revealed proportionally less gravel and more sand within the ‘direct’ impact zone, compared to the ‘indirect’ impact zone.  Whilst multivariate analyses of macrofaunal data were unable to discriminate between dredging impact zones, a comparison of univariate measures revealed significantly lower numbers of species and individuals in areas which have been subject to ‘direct’ dredging impacts in comparison with ‘reference’ areas.  This provides good evidence of the near-field consequences of dredging.  Values of these measures in the ‘indirect’ zone were intermediate, although not significantly different from the ’reference’ zone.  We conclude that, although the dominant influence on assemblages in the region is that of sediment instability induced by tidal currents, we cannot dismiss the possibility of a subsidiary influence of dredging activity in the near vicinity of the licensed block and further investigation is warranted.",Keith Cooper,TRUE,TRUE,"Biology , Benthos , Ecology - biodiversity","Aggregate , Benthos , Hamon grab , Macrobenthos , Macrofauna , Zoobenthos"

Survey work focused on rocky reefs and tidal rapids, and recorded the extent, quality and composition of the biotopes and communities. The results forms the basis for CCW Contract Science Report 611. 

Tidal Rapids are a UK Biodiversity Action Plan feature and rocky Reefs are an Annex I feature under the Habitats Directive (1992). These features are of conservation importance and the data collected during this survey is used to help define conservation objectives and inform decisions regarding protection and management. 

The survey was conducted on the shore or by diving. Survey methods were based on the standard Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) techniques using in-situ identification of conspicuous species and description of habitat and community characteristics. Subtidal and intertidal components of the fieldwork were carried out separately. Further details of these standard methodologies are given in MNCR Rational and Methods (Hiscock 1996). Each site survey was recorded immediately on standard MNCR recording forms. Work carried out for CCW under contract by Coastal Assessment, Liaison & Monitoring (CALM), Jon Moore.

<b>Rationale of the LTER Project:</b>

<i>""The future has already arrived; it just isn't evenly distributed""</i> (W. Gibson)

This is exactly our problem with the response of ecosystems to long-term trends in climate and environment. Owing to ecosystem complexity and variability in space and time, the phenomena we deal with are either long term in their dynamics, or episodic, rare, complex or subtle in their occurrence and/or manifestation. Only long-term studies, combined with experimental approaches, can reveal ecosystem dynamics, patterns and control processes. Hence, long-term research is essential to make and justify management and policy decisions regarding the protection of ecosystems and the maintenance of ecosystem services, particularly in times of potentially rapid climate change.

<b>Objectives of the LTER Project:</b>

<ul><li>To continue/establish time series of relevant and representative ecological parameters at different levels of ecosystem organisation.<li>To create well documented databases and archives of samples and specimens that are accessible to the scientific community.<li>To analyze these time series for trends and cycles by means of modern analytical  and modelling approaches.<li>To relate the observed patterns to external forcing factors on regional and global scales by means of empirical and mechanistic models.<li>To establish a cause-and-effect understanding of these relationships by analytical and experimental approaches.<li>To model future ecological developments based on the observed relationships between forcing factors and ecological parameters.<li>To provide knowledge to the broader scientific community, general public, resource managers, and policy makers to address complex environmental challenges.</ul>

The data is predominantly provided by members of the public but records are verified from photos by designated experts. No additional attribute data is included for the Carpet Sea Squirt. The recording forms for Chinese Mitten Crab and Wakame includes the option to provide abundance. Additionally for the Chinese Mitten Crab information on whether it is dead or alive is recorded and for Wakame attachment method (attached to boat, attached to other man-made surface, attach to natural surface or detached) is recorded.","Purpose of data capture: The records were collected through the Recording Invasive Species Counts (RISC) project and the ALERT system which was launched in 2010 as a partnership between the NBN, BRC and associated recording schemes and societies. The Chinese Mitten Crab, Wakame and Carpet Sea Squirt data was collated in conjunction with the Marine Biological Association. RISC is embedded within the GB-NNSIP alongside species selected as ALERT for which on-line records allow for rapid notification to the Non-Native Species Secretariat. RISC was established in raise awareness of invasive non-native species and to increase distribution data for a selection of species considered to meet a number of criteria which ensured their suitability for recording by the public. Increasing the availability of distribution data is an important component of the Non-Native Species Framework Strategy for Great Britain.

Methods of data capture: The data is collected by members of the public reporting their sightings through an on-line recording form (powered by Indicia). The records are generally casual observations but might also result from a systematic survey of a water body or surrounding locality. Records submitted with a photograph are verified by a designated expert and only these records are included within the dataset.

Geographical coverage: The geographic extent of the RISC dataset is GB. Ireland records non-native species through Invasive Ireland. The majority of records in this dataset are collated with six figure grid-references.

Temporal coverage: RISC has been promoted both during the initial launch phase and subsequently through conference talks and media attention. Additionally RISC includes mostly high profile species. The Chinese Mitten Crab has been the subject of an intense campaign of recording by the MBA with relevant partners. Therefore, recording activity is likely to have been maintained at a high level. All the records have a full date (DD/MM/YYYY).

The foreshore suppletion (400.000m³) was by means of an experimental set-up in the shallow coastal zone (-1 to -2m TAW) of Mariakerke. Beside it, a beach nourishment was conducted at Mariakerke (681243m³) and Middelkerke (968754m³). For the Mariakerke area, we collect biological and sedimentological samples in the impact area and in a control area (Bredene), before as after the suppletion, whereas for Middelkerke only the data after suppletion was part of the study. We monitor the marine ecosystem with a focus on the fauna within the sediment (macrofauna) and on the sediment (hyperbenthos, epi- and demersal fish fauna) in the intertidal zone and subtidal zone. In both studies, the subtidal area is the zone between the low water line and the 6m depth line and the intertdial area is the zone between low and high tide water line.","This dataset contain the macrobenthic data collected in the subtidal area. Macrobenthos are the biota that lives in the sediment and are retained on a sieve of 1mm.

There is sampled before the suppletion and in the following two years after suppletion. In this BACI-monitoring, the seasonal aspect is taken into account, by taking samples in spring (March) and autumn (September). In the subtidal area, three depth strata were determined to investigated the influence of the suppletion outside the suppletion area. Stratum a (between low water line and -2m TAW) is the area were the foreshore suppletion is executed. Stratum b and c are taken respectively the depth zones -3m to -4m and -5m to -6m TAW.

This survey was carried out as a baseline survey of the benthos in an area that had been proposed as an offshore windfarm. The survey area contained the proposed tidal site and potential routes for cables, 1 leading from the tidal site to Ballycastle (historic route) or leading to Drumnakill Point (northern edge of Murlough Bay) The analysis of this dataset also addressed the conservation important of the benthic communities identified along with their potential sensitivity to certain physical factors by referring to the Northern Ireland Priority Species List as well as information from the Marine Life Information Network for Britain & Ireland (MarLIN).
The methodologies for both the video tows & grab samples are detailed below.
Video survey & Analysis
• The video system used in this survey was an Osprey camera attached to an epibenthic sledge which was also fitted with a Go-Pro camera. This provided a field of view of 1m2 (oblique) for video analysis.
• The epibenthic sledge was chosen over the drop frame camera as it is a more stable platform for camera footage, especially in stronger currents (current speeds can reach up to 3ms-1 at the survey site). The sledge was towed between the sites as they were relatively close together & to optimise efficiency.
• A GPS overlay was recorded on the osprey to allow the position on the seabed to be estimates. Notes were taken of the ship’s position as well. 
• Due to site hydrodynamics, the video footage had poor visibility and was much faster than ideal. Epifauna of ~3cm and larger were identified. Biotopes were classified according to the UK MNCR classification. 
Benthic grabs & analysis
• To obtain sediment samples for infaunal analysis both a pipe dredge & a day grab were used in attempt to obtain more sediment. 
• A 0.1m2 day grab was used to take a sample of the sediment & associated infaunal communities.
• When the sample reaches the deck, a 250ml sample is taken for PSA and a further 25ml is taken for C & N analysis. The rest of the sample is carefully sieved to reveal any infauna.
• Fixed Formalin (4% buffered formaldehyde) is added to the remains of the sample and these are placed in labelled buckets.
• The samples are sent to accredited taxonomic laboratories were they are identified to as high a level as possible and weighed.
• Due to the presence of large cobbles in many regions the jaws became blocked of the day grab which meant that a large amount of sediment was lost by the time the grab reached the ship. 
• Only 4 sediment PSA were retained for analysis and 24 samples were retained for infaunal analysis (abundance & biomass data).

Selected species include some protected and non-indigenous species, ecosystem engineers, species sensitive to climate change, and/or threatened by human activities. Taken together, these taxa represent key ecological aspects of Mediterranean subtidal habitats (Cerrano et al., 2017)  and can be used to calculate the MedSens, an index of the environmental status of subtidal rocky coastal habitats based on species sensitivity (Turicchia et al., 2021). Observations were carried out by the EcoDivers (trained scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) according to a rigorous protocol (RCMed U-CEM) developed by the association Reef Check Italia onlus.","Observations were carried out by the EcoDivers (trained scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) according to a rigorous protocol (RCMed U-CEM) developed by the association Reef Check Italia onlus. Records include geographic coordinates (decimal degrees, WGS84), site name, date, survey depth range (min and max, in metres), prevailing habitat (from an options list), the sampling size in term of searching time (minutes), taxon name, abundance category (coded from 0 to 6), occurrence depth range (min and max, in metres) and the name of the EcoDiver who made the identification.
The Reef Check Med Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring (RCMed U-CEM) protocol is a Citizen Science initiative, developed by the Italian non-profit association Reef Check Italia onlus, aimed to assess the ecological status of the Mediterranean marine coastal habitats (Cerrano et al., 2017; Turicchia et al., 2021). Taxa were selected based on a combination of criteria including identification easiness and being key indicators of the shifts Mediterranean subtidal habitats may undergo under local pressures and climate change. When it is not easy to discriminate between species, genus level or higher was chosen, as in the case of the two protected Mediterranean seahorses. Before diving, each EcoDiver (i.e. the trained volunteer scuba divers, freedivers and snorkelers) chooses which and how many of the 43 taxa, included in the protocol, will be searched for, according to the expected habitat typology and personal motivations. 
Abundance (using numerical or descriptive classes according to the countability of organisms) and occurrence depth range (min and max, in metres) of searched taxa are recorded. Taxa actively searched for, but not encountered, are recorded as absent.
Diving sites are localised by using global positioning system (GPS) receivers, nautical charts or known points (e.g., mooring buoys at MPAs). Geographical coordinates (WGS84) are recorded with ± 6 arc-second (i.e. about 200 m) accuracy, which is in the distance range usually explored by divers in a single dive.
The adopted abundance categories are (in brackets the corresponding descriptive categories):
Category 0: 0 specimens (absent)
Category 1: 1 specimen (isolated specimen)
Category 2: 2 specimens (some scattered specimens)
Category 3: 3-5 specimens (several scattered specimens)

This project was fully supported by the Spanish Ministry of Environment and the scientific activities were mainly conducted by the Biodiversity and Conservation Research Group of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (part of the Research Institute ECOAQUA).

The scale of the CCV project covered almost during the same period of time the coastlines of the 8 inhabited islands, with two research teams collecting samples in selected coastal stations. The marine research inside CCV focussed on the development of the environmental diagnosis of the Canarian Archipelago’s main littoral ecosystems. We have assessed the ecological processes and environmental quality of the intertidal and subtidal ecosystems (brown algae beds, urchin barrens and seagrass meadows) as well as water quality in coastal areas. Sampling effort has been carried out biannually at 100 locations around the coastlines of the overall Canary Islands.

The identification of the physical and biological connections among MPAs will elucidate the patterns and processes of biodiversity distribution. Measures to improve protection schemes will be suggested, based on maintaining effective exchanges (biological and hydrological) between protected areas. The national coastal focus of existing MPAs will be widened to both off shore and deep sea habitats, incorporating them into the networks through examination of current legislation, to find legal solutions to set up transboundary MPAs. 2 - explore where offshore wind farms (OWF) might be established, producing an enriched wind atlas both for the Mediterranean and the Black Seas. OWF locations will avoid too sensitive habitats but the possibility for them to act as stepping-stones through MPAs, without interfering much with human activities, will be evaluated. Socioeconomic studies employing ecosystem services valuation methods to develop sustainable approaches for both MPA and OWF development will also be carried out, to complement the ecological and technological parts of the project, so as to provide guidelines to design, manage and monitor networks of MPAs and OWF. Two pilot projects (one in the Mediterranean Sea and one in the Black Sea) will test in the field the assumptions of theoretical approaches, based on previous knowledge, to find emerging properties in what we already know, in the light of the needs of the project.
